# RoadWise

This is a web application that helps users plan road trips by displaying key trip details such as distance, duration, fuel costs (based on vehicle type), and toll expenses. Integrated the OpenRouteService API for route mapping and visualization, and utilized a JSON dataset to manage toll pricing and locations.

Made using React & Vite.
