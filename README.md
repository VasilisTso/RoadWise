# RoadWise

This is a web application that helps you plan for a road trip by displaying crucial information like Distance, Duration, as well as calculating expenses like Fuel cost, depending on the kind of vehicle the user has, and Toll cost with the option to choose between a route with and without tolls. 

It is using the OpenRouteService map API key to display the map and route, as well as taking information regarding the tolls(price, location) from a Json file.

Made using React & Vite.
